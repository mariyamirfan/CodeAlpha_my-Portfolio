## 👋 About Me

Hi! I’m Mariyam — a passionate Frontend Developer who loves building clean, responsive, and user-friendly web experiences. I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript, and I enjoy creating modern UIs that work smoothly on every device.

I work on a mix of projects, including AI-powered interfaces, mobile-responsive layouts, eCommerce websites, and creative media designs. I also integrate agentic AI models and develop chat-style interfaces with smart features like text-to-speech, message actions, and chat history systems.

Currently, I have completed three major real-world projects, and I’m continuously improving my skills through hands-on learning, creativity, and experimentation.
